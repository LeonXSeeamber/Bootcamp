    "## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook serves as a guide for understanding and implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using base python, tensorflow and pytorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is an RNN?\n",
    "A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is designed to process sequential data.\n",
    "\n",
    "RNNs have feedback connections that allow them to retain information from previous steps in the sequence. This makes RNNs particularly effective for tasks such as natural language processing, speech recognition, time series analysis, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is an RNN used?\n",
    "RNNs are commonly used for tasks that involve sequential data, where the order of the data points matters. Some common applications of RNNs include:\n",
    "- Language Modelling: Predicting the next word in a sentence or generating new text.\n",
    "- Sentiment Analysis: Classifying the sentiment of a text (positive, negative, neutral).\n",
    "- Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another.\n",
    "- Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into written text.\n",
    "- Time Series Analysis: Predicting future values based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges and Optimization\n",
    " One common issue is the vanishing gradient problem, where the gradients become extremely small during backpropagation, leading to difficulties in learning long-term dependencies.\n",
    " \n",
    "To address this -> \n",
    "                   Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "                   Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n",
    "                                                         which are designed to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize an RNN model, several techniques can be employed, including:\n",
    "- Regularization: Adding dropout or L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- Batch Normalization: Normalizing the inputs to each recurrent layer to improve training stability.\n",
    "- Learning Rate Scheduling: Adjusting the learning rate during training to improve convergence.\n",
    "- Gradient Clipping: Limiting the magnitude of gradients to prevent exploding gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation of RNN Models\n",
    "To evaluate the performance of an RNN model, various metrics can be used depending on the specific task. Some common evaluation metrics for RNNs include:\n",
    "- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly predicted labels.\n",
    "- Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.\n",
    "- Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.\n",
    "- F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for time series forecasting tasks, metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can be used to measure the difference between predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this workbook, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of RNNs, their applications, optimization techniques, and evaluation methods, enabling you to effectively leverage RNNs for various sequential data tasks.\n"
